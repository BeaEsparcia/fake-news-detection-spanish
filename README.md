# Detecting Fake News in Spanish with Classical NLP

This project explores whether simple natural language processing techniques can detect patterns associated with misinformation in Spanish news articles.

Using the *Spanish Fake News Corpus*, we train and evaluate classical machine learning models based on **TF-IDF features** to classify news as true or fake.

The goal is not to determine factual truth, but to analyze whether linguistic and stylistic patterns associated with misinformation can be captured by simple models.

## Dataset

The project uses the *Spanish Fake News Corpus Version 2.0 [[ FakeDeS Task @ Iberlef 2021 ]]*, developed for research on misinformation detection in Spanish.

The dataset contains news articles labeled as *true* or *fake*, collected from online media sources and fact-checking websites.

Topics covered include:

•⁠  ⁠Politics  
•⁠  ⁠Society  
•⁠  ⁠Science  
•⁠  ⁠Covid-19    
•⁠  ⁠Environment    
•⁠  ⁠International    
•⁠  ⁠Sport

## Methodology

The pipeline follows a classical NLP approach:

1.⁠ ⁠Combine headline and article text
2.⁠ ⁠Convert text to numerical representations using *TF-IDF*
3.⁠ ⁠Train machine learning classifiers

Two models were evaluated:

•⁠  ⁠*Logistic Regression* (baseline)
•⁠  ⁠*Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)*

---

## Results

The baseline model achieved approximately:

•⁠  ⁠*Accuracy:* ~70%

Results were similar across both models, suggesting that performance is primarily constrained by the dataset size and vocabulary distribution rather than the specific algorithm.

---

## Model Interpretation

Because linear models are interpretable, we examined the most influential terms associated with each class.

The analysis suggests that the classifier relies primarily on *stylistic and contextual cues*, rather than factual verification.

For example:

•⁠  ⁠institutional or journalistic language tends to appear more often in true news
•⁠  ⁠conversational or emotional language appears more frequently in fake news predictions

---

## Error Analysis

Examples of misclassified headlines show that:

•⁠  ⁠well-written fake news can resemble legitimate journalism
•⁠  ⁠sensational but factual news may be classified as fake

This highlights the limitations of purely text-based approaches.

---

## Limitations

Several limitations should be considered:

•⁠  ⁠the dataset is relatively small
•⁠  ⁠the model relies on vocabulary patterns specific to the dataset
•⁠  ⁠misinformation detection cannot rely solely on textual features

Automated systems should therefore be considered *tools to assist human fact-checkers*, rather than systems capable of determining truth.
